The feeling of AITA or "Am I just Crazy" happens to me a lot. I think it might be the core weakness when trying to manifest confidence in my work.

Sometimes, it is not enough that your changes, be they code or process, tend to work correctly or, if you are lucky, efficiently. Something always comes in and makes me think, "No, I must be the crazy person. Why am I getting so much pushback?"

Sometimes, I think it's the evolution of some impostor syndrome, but the reality is that everything I tend to do is the first and maybe the only time I will touch it. A lifetime of one-off experiences is quite exciting, but divining a wall to kick off from at the start of every endeavor has its costs.

The reality is really perception and comprehension. I have learned that the smarter we are has very little to do with actual knowledge and, in some cases, even how fast we learn things. IQ might point otherwise, but that's not quite what I am talking about cause it's only a facet.

I really overlooked the quality of perception, especially when playing DnD. It is attached to your Wisdom trait somewhat interchangeably.

"Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition." Dnd 5e

But a person's depth of perception is really what sets us apart when it comes to divining sources of support. Simply knowing I can is almost enough. Getting others to understand you can, too, proves it.

Contextually it would be easier if you could advertise your Wisdom in a way that tells others to let you run free without having to build their confidence in your skills. Perception has been the hardest thing I have ever had to explain to someone else because some parts of my awareness are not available to them. It sounds arrogant, sure, but it's not about being better; it's just different. I also see perception as a continuum; mine is all logical and mechanical. I can't perceive an object in a new color, but I can imagine what it looks like inside out.

We have the same problem: We have a language problem explaining and comparing our perceptions. Maybe the core here is respecting others for their differences. When others don't understand you or your processes, it's possibly because we fundamentally see the world differently. Don't hold it against them or yourself.
