Not Invented Here Syndrome is something that has been entering my world a lot lately.

To be a bit reductionist this is a bias to create everything by hand or rely on our own opinions vs those from "foreign" groups.

I tend to think a brash example of this would be the Flat Earth movement. They prefer to rely on what they could experientially see and define themselves and refute those from public doctrine.

But these days I see it when we practice Big Business Bullshit Bingo (4Bs). The constant need to redefine value and process with our own words to enact a sense of possession over them.

Kinda like Science Doctrine, we have been doing the business thing for a long time. We have been selling and building and billing for much of human existence and like science we have done the due diligence and the tools have been laid bare on the table. Would it be so wrong to borrow and use them? Perhaps even enhance them with our own distinct color and give them back.

I find this modality funny because I love open source which constantly teeters on NIH and standardization. But as a proof NIH becomes standardization not the other way around successfully. That process is through great collaboration and effort.

There must be some psychological effect that happens as we mature in a career where we, myself included, start forgetting that not all good ideas are our own and that bespoke for the sake of possession is meerly a siren song.

TLDR; Be boring, get shit done, fix only whats broke!
