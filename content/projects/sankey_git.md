## Idea generation

Something odd about idea generation is its heredity. Maybe a sankey isn't the right way to diagram it but I think it would look cool if it was weighted by number of commits and the distance between commits.

Probably relational timestamps for related gits could inform on the branching order. I dunno.

### Tagging
So for that work I need a network of git repos or todolist items sharing the same tags

### Logseq

Probably the same is true about logseq graphs if I can track time.
