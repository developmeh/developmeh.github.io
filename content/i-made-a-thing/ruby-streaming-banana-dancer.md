**Hey there, fellow coder! Ever seen a parrot dance in your terminal?** 🦜💃

If you've taken a trip to `parrot.live`, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's quirky, it's fun, and yes, a parrot dances right there in your terminal. But what if I told you there's another dancing star in town? And it's not a bird. Meet the *Ruby Streaming ANSI Banana*! 🍌

Yeah, I did say banana. 

So, here’s the scoop. I was chilling, thinking about how much I enjoyed that dancing parrot, and a thought popped up: "Could I do this with Ruby? And maybe... not a parrot?" Fast forward, and ta-da, a dancing banana was born. It clears your terminal screen with some nifty ANSI tricks and then gets its groove on. It's like the parrot, but you know, it’s a banana... and it's Ruby.

Now, I hear you: "But... why a banana?" The real question is, why not? Coding isn’t just about solving serious problems; it's also about having a bit of fun, letting your hair down, and, occasionally, making fruit dance in your terminal.

The best part? If you're team CURL, you're just one command away from some smooth banana moves. The banana doesn’t just dance—it does so smoothly, with some chunk-encoded charm ensuring that every move is in sync, right in your terminal.

So, curious? Want to dive into some fruity fun? Swing by [ruby_streaming_ansi_banana](https://github.com/developmeh/ruby_streaming_ansi_banana) and see it for yourself. And if you’re feeling extra creative, why not customize it? Maybe a shimmying strawberry or a waltzing watermelon?

Bottom line: In the world of code, there's always room for a dance, even if it's just a banana showing off its moves. So, let's not take ourselves too seriously and enjoy the rhythm, one ASCII character at a time!

Hope your keyboard’s ready for some dancing fun! 🍌🕺🎵
