**Hey there, fellow coder! Ever seen a parrot dance in your terminal?** 🦜💃

If you've taken a trip to `parrot.live`, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's quirky, it's fun, and yes, a parrot dances right there in your terminal. But what if I told you there's another dancing star in town? And it's not a bird. Meet the *Ruby Streaming ANSI Banana*! 🍌

Yeah, I did say banana. 

So, here’s the scoop. I was chilling, thinking about how much I enjoyed that dancing parrot, and a thought popped up: "Could I do this with Ruby? And maybe... not a parrot?" Fast forward, and ta-da, a dancing banana was born. It clears your terminal screen with some nifty ANSI tricks and then gets its groove on. It's like the parrot, but you know, it’s a banana... and it's Ruby.

Now, I hear you: "But... why a banana?" The real question is, why not? Coding isn’t just about solving serious problems; it's also about having a bit of fun, letting your hair down, and, occasionally, making fruit dance in your terminal.

The best part? If you're team CURL, you're just one command away from some smooth banana moves. The banana doesn’t just dance—it does so smoothly, with some chunk-encoded charm ensuring that every move is in sync, right in your terminal.

So, curious? Want to dive into some fruity fun? Swing by [ruby_streaming_ansi_banana](https://github.com/developmeh/ruby_streaming_ansi_banana) and see it for yourself. And if you’re feeling extra creative, why not customize it? Maybe a shimmying strawberry or a waltzing watermelon?

Bottom line: In the world of code, there's always room for a dance, even if it's just a banana showing off its moves. So, let's not take ourselves too seriously and enjoy the rhythm, one ASCII character at a time!

Hope your keyboard’s ready for some dancing fun! 🍌🕺🎵

## DevLog

#### Beating Nix

In the last update I made some breaking changes to the project's cross-platform-ness which bothered me but I find nix challenging at times. Since I was starting with something that worked though migrating it to one that supports all platforms was easier.

[flake.nix](https://github.com/developmeh/ruby_streaming_ansi_banana/blob/v0.2.0/flake.nix)

Starting here we create a lambda that accepts the __system__ argument. Later this will inherit the supported system of that loop over __[ "x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux" "x86_64-darwin" "aarch64-darwin" ]__.

```nix
forEachSupportedSystem = f: nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs supportedSystems (system: f {
  system = system;  # Ensure the 'system' is passed into the function
  pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
});
```

Next we will define how __gems__ are created and they will inherit the supported system for the host env.

This function accepts the system and builds the bundler env.

```nix
gems = system: let
  buildpkgs = import nixpkgs { system = system; };
in buildpkgs.bundlerEnv {
  name = "ruby-dancing-banana";
  ruby = buildpkgs.ruby_3_2;
  gemfile = ./Gemfile;
  lockfile = ./Gemfile.lock;
  gemset = ./gemset.nix;
};
```

Next we use that function to inherit the bundler env for our docker image. The gems function is invoked __gemEnv = gems systemAttrs.system__. Those attributes were generated in this scope using the nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs. In that block above we exposed a __system = ...__ its values were mapped to __systemAttrs__.

We do the same thing to alias our package source for nix __buildpkgs__.

When we do __nix build__ buildImage will be invoked.

```nix
buildImage = systemAttrs: let
  buildpkgs = import nixpkgs { system = systemAttrs.system; };
  gemEnv = gems systemAttrs.system;
in buildpkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
  name = "ruby-dancing-banana";
  created = "now";
  tag = "latest";
  copyToRoot = buildpkgs.buildEnv {
    name = "image-root";
    paths = [
      gemEnv
    ];
    postBuild = ''
      mkdir -p $out/app
      cp ${./main.rb} $out/app/main.rb
      cp -r ${./ascii_frames} $out/app/ascii_frames
    '';
  };
  config = {
    Cmd = [ "${gemEnv.wrappedRuby}/bin/ruby" "/app/main.rb" "-o" "0.0.0.0" ];
    WorkingDir = "/app";
    ExposedPorts = { "4567/tcp" = {}; };
  };
};
```

This is the same for our devShells. The difference here is we need these values in our __output__ defined at the very top so we call __forEachSupportedSystem__ and the attached block defines our default shell for the host env.

I have to admit. This might be the first time I have understood what I created in nix. The rest of the time I have been trying to just guess my way through by copy-pasta'ing examples. Its not a tough syntax and provides much more than what is popular. But all this functionality comes at the cost of being understandable.

__Cloudflare Streaming__

The final part of todays journey was addressing streaming with __Cloudflare Tunnel__. Being its sitting inside my connection it makes its own rules and that means I have to force it to not buffer my streams otherwise the rendering is faulty.

Solution:
```ruby
headers.delete('Content-Length')
headers "Content-Encoding" => "identity"
headers "Content-Type" => "text/event-stream"
headers "Transfer-Encoding" => "chunked"
```

Removing _Content-Length_ makes sure the proxy can't anticipate the stream and wait for it.

_Content-Encoding_ Identity helps to keep compression for being activated.

_Content-Type_ text/event-stream is the magic bullet which hints to the proxy that we want the data streamed and to disable any caching or bursting.

_Transfer-Encoding_ "chunked" makes sure we send a full block at a time. Since I flush on each image presented each write is a chunk.

#### Nix and planning for ruby streaming

I gotta admit I love nix a lot. Its the underdog to docker and even so I use it to create docker images. Although this is kind of a weird thing because when you consider nix you don't really need containers. Ultimately, nix was an alternative view of container runtimes. That said we have k8s and that is a container orchestration tool. That means I use nix to define consistent builds that produce docker images.

Lets walk back what using nix with something like ruby is like. I have previously done this with golang and that was a fun path https://git.sr.ht/~ninjapanzer/krappy_kafka/tree/main/item/flake.nix#L41-59

There we have a buildGoApplication extension to package a binary. That is rather easy because once done we execute that binary and orchestrate any file systems required.

In ruby we don't have a compile phase so we need to carry our bundled baggage. In this world we take the artifacts from bundler and describe them as nix store resources. Those are then copied to the container. In this world even the ruby version is part of the bundled nix context. Within the container we find these in the /nix/store path.

What I learned is that everything eventually is sourced from the nix store. Whats nice is we don't need bundler anymore since the path around the ruby runtime mixed with the context of our gems. While locally we might need to run **bundle exec ruby ...** now we use **"${gems.wrappedRuby}/bin/ruby** as our cmd.

Since this is my second time building a docker image for an arbitrary project, it feels less confusing. The big difference is where the build phase happens. In golang we build and then create an image. In languages like ruby we prepare our deps and then do build operations while copying files to root.

This really makes sense since we do the exact same thing outside nix. In go I would have a make operation that builds our binary and our dockerfile copies that file to the image.

With ruby we tend to bundle within the docker image creation. That is where this is magic, we don't do that anymore and as a result the docker image creation is super fast. Since we don't have to re-bundle on each build its easier to cache the nix env for our gems and the operation becomes one of copying instead of re-downloading and possibly compiling them. This eliminates the __compiling__ we are used to in the ruby space.

Sorry guys, gotta keep working now
