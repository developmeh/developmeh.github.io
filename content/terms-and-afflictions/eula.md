## Equipment
You will __only__ operate a device that is __not__ the same architecture as your production systems at all times. This device will have enough mass to damage your furnature if dropped. While this equipment will come pre-installed with tools applicable to your daily activities, they will be woefully outdated and do not work the same as industry standard. While not able to be deleted you will need to shadow these tools with public versions and keep them configured. You will be provided with no less than two hardware virtualization platforms both of which require significant performance impacts on daily operations. You will use this equipment as a form of status in the caste system of enterprise software development. You are required to politely shun others with "inferrior" equipment. You will be required to operate your daily activities with half the storage resources as "inferrior" equipment due to the great overhead of modern day silicon chips and design processes.
