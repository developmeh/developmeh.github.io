## Developmeh
_Develop ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯_

Contained within are hairbrained ideas that have no commercial value... still here... you are one of the special ones.

I have done a lot of software engineering in my life and after all that time I have come to appreciate an industry in constant evolution.
> I, though, seem to stand as a fixed point, arriving to accomplish a specific task and obstinately refusing to become a tradesman.

For those of you who have a craft and participate in a creative act on the regular, I salute you. Your bravery is what I idolize. In persuite of of some kind of self-idolatry I create toys to expand my knowledge and forgive myself for being a shill.
>But who cares? Welcome to my workshop!

This is a safe space for all ideas; the point is to have fun with it; you don't wanna write tests...suuuuure....
> GET THE HELL OUT! I am not some kind of heathen. I have standards, bud.
