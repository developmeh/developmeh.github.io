## Developmeh
_Develop ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯_

You know they say you have hundreds of incredible ideas each day, but they are so fleeting you don't execute them.

But who cares? Welcome to my workshop!

This is a safe space for all ideas; the point is to have fun with it; you don't wanna write tests...suuuuure....
